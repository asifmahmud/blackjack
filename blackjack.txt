How I designed my program:
    1. I have created two functions: playerPrompt and dealerSimulation. One deals cards to the player prompts for additional options and calculates the total.
       The other simulates dealer's cards and calculates the total.
       
    2. In the function which deals cards to the player, I call dealerSimulation when the player presses 0, indicating that he no longer wants cards to be dealt.
       dealerSimulation then takes the total of the player and runs dealer simulation. The results are then displayed accordingly.
    
    3. In the main function, I call playerPrompt to start the game.
